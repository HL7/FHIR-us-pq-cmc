### Bundle Overview
<p>Materials used in the manufacture of the drug substance (e.g., raw materials, starting materials, solvents, reagents, catalysts) should be listed, identifying where each material is used in the process. Information on the quality and control of these materials should be provided. Information demonstrating that materials (including biologically sourced materials (e.g., media components, monoclonal antibodies, enzymes)) meet standards appropriate for their intended use (including the clearance or control of adventitious agents) should be provided, as appropriate. For biologically sourced materials, this can include information on the source, manufacture, and characterization. Reference ICH guidances Q6A and Q6B. 
</p>
<p>
For Biotech:  Control of Source and Starting Materials of Biological Origin Summaries of viral safety information for biologically sourced materials should be provided. (Provide details in the Adventitious Agents Safety Evaluation section of the Appendix 3.2.A.2.) 
Source, history, and generation of the cell substrate Information on the source of the cell substrate and analysis of the expression construct used to genetically modify cells and incorporated in the initial cell clone used to develop the master cell bank should be provided as described in ICH guidances Q5B and Q5D. 
</p>
<p>
Cell banking system, characterization, and testing Information on the cell banking system, quality control activities, and cell line stability during production and storage (including procedures used to generate the master and working cell banks) should be provided as described in Q5B and Q5D. Reference ICH guidances Q5A, Q5B, Q5C, and Q5D.
