# Using UCUM codes like %{WeightToWeight}, %{WeightToVolume}, and %{VolumeToVolume} for drug product specifications offers key advantages: they ensure consistency, reduce errors, meet regulatory requirements (e.g., eCTD, FHIR), simplify data exchange with machine-readable formats, clearly define concentration types (e.g., w/w, w/v, v/v), and support international collaboration by overcoming language and unit barriers. These codes enhance clarity, compliance, and efficiency in pharmaceutical processes, and are not being used in computations.
%UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {WeightToWeight} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked

# These are all inherited from Core Specification.
