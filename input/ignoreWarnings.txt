# Codes are valid UCUM codes. Not in FHIR list
The code '[NTU]' is not valid in the system http://unitsofmeasure.org (Unknown code '[NTU]' in the CodeSystem 'http://unitsofmeasure.org' version '2.0.1')

# WeightToWeight is known expression in pharmaceutical manufacturing
UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {WeightToWeight} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked

# They are inline examples so that they just show in the bundles.  Comes from having to restrict references to be bundled only. The usage is set to inline because the publisher does not support remote reference defined in the bundle.
